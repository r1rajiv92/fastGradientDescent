# logRegFastGradientDescent

Logistic Regression is a machine learning technique used to solve classification problems. Here, we have implemented logistic regression with L2 loss optimized using fast gradient descent algorithm. We have also included sample code that you can run on a simulated or a real world dataset. We have also written a library where you can compare the performance between sklearn and our implementation.

# DataSets
The spam dataset that is used in the demo file can be found in the repository itself.
